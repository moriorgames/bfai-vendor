BFAI Vendor
===========

This project is intended to give support to the bfai project.

I like to split dependencies. In this project I put the most low level logic of the game.
The Core rules, the movements, de damages, the specifics of the battle.
The project is splitted because is easier to test and mantain.

There is a deploy script that will help you to deploy this tested source code to the main videogame project

```
$ sh scripts/deploy.sh 
```
